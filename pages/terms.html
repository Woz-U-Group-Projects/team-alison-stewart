        <p>
          Artona is very respectful about the privacy concerns of the
          visitors to its sites on the Internet. Please see our Customer
          Privacy Statement at (Privacy Statement). This Website places a "cookie"
          in the browser files of an Artona user’s computer. The cookie itself
          does not contain any personally identifying information. Although the
          cookie could enable Artona to relate a user’s use of an Artona site
          to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided,
          Artona does not do so for any kids’ sites. Users should be aware that
          when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name,
          e-mail address, telephone number) on the bulletin boards or in the chat
          areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may
          result in unsolicited messages from other people.

        <h2 class="headline">A Special Note for Parents Concerning Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          On sites specifically designed for children, Artona makes a special
          effort to encourage children to consult with their parents before
          furnishing data. However, Artona believes that parents should supervise
          their children’s online activities and consider using parental control
          tools available from online services and software manufacturers that
          help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also
          prevent children from disclosing online their name, address and other
          personal information without parental permission.
        <p>

        <h2 class="headline">Linked Sites</h2>
