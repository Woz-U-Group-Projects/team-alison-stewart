              Information technology has brought many ways to do business. It allows businesses and
              customers to interact through electronic means that enables companies to conduct their
              business efficiently and provide the highest standard of customer service. At the same time,
              this has brought legitimate concerns about security and privacy of personal information
              passed from the customer to the business.
            </li>
            <li>
              We at The Artona Group Inc. (“Artona”)
              are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. Your personal information is
              fundamental in the way we conduct our business. Artona’s Customer Privacy Policy provides
              the principles in which Artona will adhere to protect your personal information. Artona’s
              Customer Privacy Policy complies with the provision set out by the Canadian Personal
              Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5 (PIPEDA).

          <ol class="list--vertical">
            <li>
              The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), of the federal
              government, significantly impacts the way private businesses, corporations, federal agencies,
              not-for-profit organizations and associations handle the personal information they have
              collected in the course of their business. At the same time, it will clearly establish a
              code of privacy practices that will provide Canadians from coast to coast with a mechanism
              to ensure their personal information is handled respectfully.
            </li>
            <li>
              PIPEDA acknowledges the need to protect an individual’s right to privacy and also addresses
              the necessity of collecting private information for businesses in the conduct of their business
              affair. The act provides guidelines and principles for businesses for the accountability,
              purpose, obtaining of consent, disclosure, accuracy, safeguarding, openness of policy and
              access to personal information that was entrusted to its care.
            </li>
            <li>
              The PIPEDA principles:

              <ol class="list--vertical">
                <li>accountability</li>
                <li>identifying the purposes for personal information collection</li>

                <li>limiting the collection of personal information</li>
                <li>limiting use, disclosure, and retention of personal information</li>
                <li>accuracy of personal information</li>
