Once the Properties window opens up, proceed to “Settings” by clicking on the corresponding tab at the top right of the window. Finally, from this tab you may use the line bar located under “Screen Resolution” to increase the current resolution. Try to use a setting of at least 1024x768 pixels.</p>

    How do I request a new Student ID/GoCard?
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>If the information on your Student ID Card/GoCard is incorrect, please speak to the administration staff at your school to have a new ID Card/GoCard produced.</p>

<p>If you have misplaced your Student ID/GoCard, there are two ways to obtaining a new one.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> - Go to your school office to request a new Student ID/GoCard. Artona delivers GoCards to schools bi-weekly.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> - If you need a new Student ID/GoCard immediately, you can get one from Artona directly. You will need to obtain an original Translink form (not a photocopy)from your school office, come down to Artona, and pay the $25 fee (Tax Included). The student requesting the Student ID/GoCard must be present and show a valid piece of Government&nbsp;identification with the students date of birth, as the GoCard is processed and printed on location.</p>

    My mailbox is probably too small for my order. How will it be delivered?

  <div class="answer">
    <p>We respect our customers' privacy and have a strict policy that prevents Purolator (the shipping service provider) from leaving customer orders unattended in an unsafe area and in which the package may be subject to damage from the weather.</p>

<p>If you are not at home during the time of delivery and there is no safe area to place your package, a note from Purolator will be attached to your door or mailbox with specific instructions on how to pick up your order from the nearest dispatch centre.</p>
